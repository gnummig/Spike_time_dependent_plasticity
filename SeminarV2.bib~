	abstract = {Natural vision is a highly dynamic process. Frequent body, head, and eye movements constantly bring new images onto the retina for brief periods, challenging our understanding of the neural code for vision. We report that certain retinal ganglion cells encode the spatial structure of a briefly presented image in the relative timing of their first spikes. This code is found to be largely invariant to stimulus contrast and robust to noisy fluctuations in response latencies. Mechanistically, the observed response characteristics result from different kinetics in two retinal pathways (“ON” and “OFF”) that converge onto ganglion cells. This mechanism allows the retina to rapidly and reliably transmit new spatial information with the very first spikes emitted by a neural population.
In salamanders, ganglion cells, which project from the retina to the brain, use the relative timing of single spikes in each cell to quickly encode a visual scene.

	title = {Biological constraints on connectionist modelling},
	abstract = {Many researchers interested in connectionist models accept that such models are \&quot;neurally inspired \&quot; but do not worry too much about whether their models are biologically realistic. While such a position may be perfectly justifiable, the present paper attempts to illustrate how biological information can be used to constrain connectionist models. Two particular areas are discussed. The first section deals with visual information processing in the primate and human visual system. It is argued that speed with which visual information is processed imposes major constraints on the architecture and operation of the visual system. In particular, it seems that a great deal of processing must depend on a single bottum-up pass. The second section deals with biological aspects of learning algorithms. It is argued that although there is good evidence for certain coactivation related synaptic modification schemes, other learning mechanisms, including back-propagation, are not currently supported by experimental data.},

	abstract = {Over the past 15 years, we have developed software image processing systems that attempt to reproduce the sorts of spike-based processing strategies used in biological vision. The basic idea is that sophisticated visual processing can be achieved with a single wave of spikes by using the relative timing of spikes in different neurons as an efficient code. While software simulations are certainly an option, it is now becoming clear that it may well be possible to reproduce the same sorts of ideas in specific hardware. Firstly, several groups have now developed spiking retina chips in which the pixel elements send the equivalent of spikes in response to particular events such as increases or a decreases in local luminance. Importantly, such chips are fully asynchronous, allowing image processing to break free of the standard frame based approach. We have recently shown how simple neural network architectures can use the output of such dynamic spiking retinas to perform sophisticated tasks by using a biologically inspired learning rule based on Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP). Such systems can learn to detect meaningful patterns that repeat in a purely unsupervised way. For example, after just a few minutes of training, a network composed of a first layer of 60 neurons and a second layer of 10 neurons was able to form neurons that could effectively count the number of cars going by on the different lanes of a freeway. For the moment, this work has just used simulations. However, there is a real possibility that the same processing strategies could be implemented in memristor-based hardware devices. If so, it will become possible to build intelligent image processing systems capable of learning to recognize significant events without the need for conventional computational hardware.},
