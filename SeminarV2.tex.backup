\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In here I present a review of research and technologies using asynchronous spike-based processing strategies as can be observed in biological vision.
The research presented includes a general description of the issue \cite{thorpe_spike-based_2012}\cite{bialek_reading_1991}, the presentation of a 
silicon retina \cite{lichtsteiner_128_2008} and a silicon cochlea \cite{}.
while the common approach to immitate neural networks is simulation on conventional hardware as CPU's and GPU's this review is rather focussed on the 
efforts being made to reproduce the property of neural structures to work vastly parallel. in special this review will look at the fact that the 
biological vision system is able to compute relevant information wiith just one spike per neuron, due to the relative timing of spikes.
\end{abstract}

\section{Biological Vision and why it is spike-timing-based} 
The speed of biological vision poses a problem for conventional views of how information is processed in the brain.
As wil be demonstrated, the notion of spike-frequency encoding of information contradicts the speed at which neurons at the highest 
level of the primate vision system can respond selectively to complex stimuli such as faces.
Studies have shown that such processes can be accomplished in as much as 100ms, which combined with the fact, that cortical neurons seldomly
show fire faster than every 10 ms and that there are about 10 stages of neurons involved between the photo receptors and the high level 
neurons, leads to the conclusion that each neuron has in average only time to fire once.
It is therefore proposed, that rather than the information being only encoded in firing frequencies corresponding to analog values,
the relative timing of the spikes is also used to encode such information.
This idea shas been demonstrated experimentally using recordings from the salamander retina\cite{gollisch_rapid_2008}.
It is showed by simulation, that it is possible to do state of the art face recognition using an approach, 
where every neuron is only allowed to fire at most once. \cite{}

As an information processing unit, the biological vision aparatus is an extraordinanry piece of engineering, when it comes to speed.
Despite the fact that neurons spike at most 100 times per second, and that the condutcion of of spikes through the axons works at about 1$ms^-1$, 
we can recognize faces after 100 ms only. 
considering, that in the process of grasping an image, there are about 10 stages of neurons between the photoreceptors 
and the end of the visual system, means that each neuron has 10 ms to reach a conclusion

Now the true power of biological brains comes from the highly interconnected gross of neurons, 
And engineers are stil far from constructing something equivalent on silicon basis

This is a sample file. Please use this file to correctly typeset a
submission to the Seminar conference. The associated pdf file will
help you to have an idea of what your paper should look like.

\subsection{Page format and margins}
Please avoid using DVI2PDF or PS2PDF converters: some undesired
shifting/scaling may occur when using these programs
It is strongly recommended to use the DVIPS converters. 
%
Check that you have set the paper size to A4 (and NOT to letter) in your
dvi2ps converter, in Adobe Acrobat if you use it, and in any printer driver
that you could use.  You also have to disable the 'scale to fit paper' option
of your printer driver.
%
In any case, please check carefully that the final size of the top and
bottom margins is 5.2 cm and of the left and right margins is 4.4 cm.
%t is your responsibility to verify this important requirement.  If these margin requirements and not fulfilled at the end of your file generation process, please use the commands at the beginning of the SeminarV2.tex file to correct them.  Otherwise, please do not modify these commands.


\subsection{Additional packages and functions}

Update the sample file according to your text. You can add
packages or declare new \LaTeX\ functions if and only if there is no conflict between your packages and the SeminarV2.cls style file.

\subsection{Style information}

\subsubsection{Page numbers}
Please do not add page numbers to this style; page numbers will be added by the publisher.
\subsubsection{Page headings}
Do not add headings to your document.
\subsection{Mathematics}
You may include additional packages for typesetting
algorithms, mathematical formula or to define new operators and environments
if and only if there is no conflict with the SeminarV2.cls
file.

It is recommended to avoid the numbering of equations when not
necessary. When dealing with equation arrays, it could be
necessary to label several (in)equalities. You can do it using the
`$\backslash$stackrel' operator (see the SeminarV2.tex source file);
example:

\begin{eqnarray}
c&=&|d|+|e|\nonumber\\
&\stackrel{\text{(a)}}{=}&d+e\nonumber\\
&\stackrel{\text{(b)}}{\geq}&\sqrt{f}\enspace,
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where the equality (a) results from the fact that both
$d$ and $e$ are positive while (b) comes from the definition of
$f$.

\subsection{Tables and figures}

Figure \ref{Fig:MV} shows an example of figure and related
caption.  Do not use too small symbols and lettering in your
figures.  Warning: your paper will be printed in black and white
in the proceedings.  You may insert color figures, but it is your
responsibility to check that they print correctly in black and
white.  The color version will be kept in the Seminar electronic
proceedings available on the web.
