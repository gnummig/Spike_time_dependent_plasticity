	abstract = {Traditional approaches to neural coding characterize the encoding of known stimuli in average neural responses. Organisms face nearly the opposite task--extracting information about an unknown time-dependent stimulus from short segments of a spike train. Here the neural code was characterized from the point of view of the organism, culminating in algorithms for real-time stimulus estimation based on a single example of the spike train. These methods were applied to an identified movement-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system. Such decoding experiments determined the effective noise level and fault tolerance of neural computation, and the structure of the decoding algorithms suggested a simple model for real-time analog signal processing with spiking neurons.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a 128 times 128 pixel CMOS vision sensor. Each pixel independently and in continuous time quantizes local relative intensity changes to generate spike events. These events appear at the output of the sensor as an asynchronous stream of digital pixel addresses. These address-events signify scene reflectance change and have sub-millisecond timing precision. The output data rate depends on the dynamic content of the scene and is typically orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional frame-based imagers. By combining an active continuous-time front-end logarithmic photoreceptor with a self-timed switched-capacitor differencing circuit, the sensor achieves an array mismatch of 2.1\% in relative intensity event threshold and a pixel bandwidth of 3 kHz under 1 klux scene illumination. Dynamic range is {\textgreater} 120 dB and chip power consumption is 23 mW. Event latency shows weak light dependency with a minimum of 15 mus at {\textgreater} 1 klux pixel illumination. The sensor is built in a 0.35 mum 4M2P process. It has 40times40 mum2 pixels with 9.4\% fill factor. By providing high pixel bandwidth, wide dynamic range, and precisely timed sparse digital output, this silicon retina provides an attractive combination of characteristics for low-latency dynamic vision under uncontrolled illumination with low post-processing requirements.},

	abstract = {Natural vision is a highly dynamic process. Frequent body, head, and eye movements constantly bring new images onto the retina for brief periods, challenging our understanding of the neural code for vision. We report that certain retinal ganglion cells encode the spatial structure of a briefly presented image in the relative timing of their first spikes. This code is found to be largely invariant to stimulus contrast and robust to noisy fluctuations in response latencies. Mechanistically, the observed response characteristics result from different kinetics in two retinal pathways (“ON” and “OFF”) that converge onto ganglion cells. This mechanism allows the retina to rapidly and reliably transmit new spatial information with the very first spikes emitted by a neural population.
In salamanders, ganglion cells, which project from the retina to the brain, use the relative timing of single spikes in each cell to quickly encode a visual scene.

	abstract = {In this paper we present a very exciting overlap between emergent nanotechnology and neuroscience, which has been discovered by neuromorphic engineers. Specifically, we are linking one type of memristor nanotechnology devices to the biological synaptic update rule known as spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) found in real biological synapses. Understanding this link allows neuromorphic engineers to develop circuit architectures that use this type of memristors to artificially emulate parts of the visual cortex. We focus on the type of memristors referred to as voltage or flux driven memristors and focus our discussions on a behavioral macro-model for such devices. The implementations result in fully asynchronous architectures with neurons sending their action potentials not only forward but also backward. One critical aspect is to use neurons that generate spikes of specific shapes. We will see how by changing the shapes of the neuron action potential spikes we can tune and manipulate the STDP learning rules for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We will see how neurons and memristors can be interconnected to achieve large scale spiking learning systems, that follow a type of multiplicative STDP learning rule. We will briefly extend the architectures to use three-terminal transistors with similar memristive behavior. We will illustrate how a V1 visual cortex layer can assembled and how it is capable of learning to extract orientations from visual data coming from a real artificial CMOS spiking retina observing real life scenes. Finally, we will discuss limitations of currently available memristors. The results presented are based on behavioral simulations and do not take into account non-idealities of devices and interconnects. The aim of this paper is to present, in a tutorial manner, an initial framework for the possible development of fully asynchronous STDP learning neuromorphic architectures exploiting two or three-terminal memristive type devices.

	title = {Biological constraints on connectionist modelling},
	abstract = {Many researchers interested in connectionist models accept that such models are \&quot;neurally inspired \&quot; but do not worry too much about whether their models are biologically realistic. While such a position may be perfectly justifiable, the present paper attempts to illustrate how biological information can be used to constrain connectionist models. Two particular areas are discussed. The first section deals with visual information processing in the primate and human visual system. It is argued that speed with which visual information is processed imposes major constraints on the architecture and operation of the visual system. In particular, it seems that a great deal of processing must depend on a single bottum-up pass. The second section deals with biological aspects of learning algorithms. It is argued that although there is good evidence for certain coactivation related synaptic modification schemes, other learning mechanisms, including back-propagation, are not currently supported by experimental data.},

	abstract = {Over the past 15 years, we have developed software image processing systems that attempt to reproduce the sorts of spike-based processing strategies used in biological vision. The basic idea is that sophisticated visual processing can be achieved with a single wave of spikes by using the relative timing of spikes in different neurons as an efficient code. While software simulations are certainly an option, it is now becoming clear that it may well be possible to reproduce the same sorts of ideas in specific hardware. Firstly, several groups have now developed spiking retina chips in which the pixel elements send the equivalent of spikes in response to particular events such as increases or a decreases in local luminance. Importantly, such chips are fully asynchronous, allowing image processing to break free of the standard frame based approach. We have recently shown how simple neural network architectures can use the output of such dynamic spiking retinas to perform sophisticated tasks by using a biologically inspired learning rule based on Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP). Such systems can learn to detect meaningful patterns that repeat in a purely unsupervised way. For example, after just a few minutes of training, a network composed of a first layer of 60 neurons and a second layer of 10 neurons was able to form neurons that could effectively count the number of cars going by on the different lanes of a freeway. For the moment, this work has just used simulations. However, there is a real possibility that the same processing strategies could be implemented in memristor-based hardware devices. If so, it will become possible to build intelligent image processing systems capable of learning to recognize significant events without the need for conventional computational hardware.},

	shorttitle = {Why spikes?},
	abstract = {Hebbian learning allows a network of spiking neurons to store and retrieve spatio-temporal patterns with a time resolution of 1 ms, despite the long postsynaptic and dendritic integration times. To show this, we introduce and analyze a model of spiking neurons, the spike response model, with a realistic distribution of axonal delays and with realistic postsynaptic potentials. Learning is performed by a local Hebbian rule which is based on the synchronism of presynaptic neurotransmitter release and some short-acting postsynaptic process. The time window of this synchronism determines the temporal resolution of pattern retrieval, which can be initiated by applying a short external stimulus pattern. Furthermore, a rate quantization is found in dependence upon the threshold value of the neurons, i.e., in a given time a pattern runs n times as often as learned, when n is a positive integer (n {\textgreater} or = 0). We show that all information about the spike pattern is lost if only mean firing rates (temporal average) or ensemble activities (spatial average) are considered. An average over several retrieval runs in order to generate a post-stimulus time histogram may also deteriorate the signal. The full information on a pattern is contained in the spike raster of a single run. Our results stress the importance, and advantage, of coding by spatio-temporal spike patterns instead of firing rates and average ensemble activity. The implications regarding modelling and experimental data analysis are discussed.},
